 * trapped and nothing outside is hidden — the tab strip and composer beside
 * it stay in use, which is the whole point of taking over the transcript
 * rather than the window. ChatAttachmentViewer is the modal sibling, for
 * views that should take everything. What it does cover, it covers
 * completely: the siblings it is drawn over go inert while it is open, so
 * nothing behind it takes focus or a pointer.
 *
 * Escape closes the view from inside it, after any control that stops the
 * keystroke first has had it, and the fade honors reduced motion.
