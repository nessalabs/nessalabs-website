 *
 * The ramp has two steps per slot, and a component takes the one its mark
 * calls for: a radar outline is a two-pixel line, so it takes the solid step and
 * dilutes that same colour for its area wash. Both are tokens, so each theme carries
 * its own pair — a pale tint on the light surface, a deep one on the dark.
 * The slot ORDER is the colour-vision-deficiency safety mechanism:
 * neighbouring slots are the pairs a reader compares, and this order is the
 * one that clears the separation gates in both themes. Reordering it, or
 * generating a ninth hue, breaks that guarantee.
