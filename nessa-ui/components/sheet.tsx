 * stretches under the pointer while the drag lasts. The drawer lifts
 * a short way from the bottom on open; expand and minimize interpolate
 * height so the panel grows and recedes in place. Both use the slow
 * duration and standard easing so the motion stays one language. Dismissal
 * slides the panel back out before the host is told to unmount it, so the
